This task manager will be built using Flask, the SLQAlchemy ORM, and a frontend framework called Materialize.
The task manager will have full CRUD functionality, which
allows us to create, read, update, and delete items on our database.
This will be done in the context of a Flask application.
I will also create HTML-based user interfaces to demonstrate these CRUD calls in action.
For good user experience, I will style these interfaces using the Materialize framework.

the homepage will display a summary of tasks, which will consist of of task name, due date and whetehr or not it is an urgetn task. 

Users will be able to create new tasks, view their tasks, edit tasks, and finally, delete their tasks.
In addition to performing CRUD functionality for tasks, users will also be able to perform
the same thing with various categories.
The app will be fully responsive due to the fact that we will use the Materialize framework grid-based classes.
